## useState

useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.

## useEffect

useEffect is a hook in React that allows us to run side effects or manage state changes after the component has rendered and the DOM has been updated. This means that we can use useEffect to fetch data from an API, update the state, and re-render the component with the new data.
